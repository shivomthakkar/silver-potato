# Sentiment Analysis on the IMDB Dataset

Sentiment Analysis aims to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative, leveraging natural language processing and deep learning techniques.

This project demonstrates how to build a Sentiment Analysis model using Word2Vec embeddings (from Gensim), TensorFlow, and Bidirectional LSTMs (Bi-LSTMs) to classify movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as positive or negative.

## Overview

This repository contains the code and notebook for performing Sentiment Analysis on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. The model architecture leverages pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings for encoding textual data and a Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) for classification. The project also makes use of TensorFlow as the primary deep learning framework.


## Features

```
- Preprocessing the IMDB dataset to prepare for model training.
- Generating and using Word2Vec embeddings for text representation using the Gensim library.
- Building and training a Bidirectional LSTM model using TensorFlow.
- Evaluating the modelâ€™s performance on test data.
- Visualizing model performance with accuracy and loss curves.
```

You can find the complete walkthrough and implementation in the main.ipynb notebook provided in this repository.
